    Weather bot is an individual bot which stays at one game and responds to chat commands like !weather. If you join the bot's game and say !weather cityname, it will tell you the weather of the city. There are currently 5 weather bots operated simultaneously in 5 different servers.

    Once you've bought your Weather PLUS membership, you must first use the '!checkplus' command in order to verify yourself. You only have to do this once and this verification will be permanently saved. In order for '!checkplus' to work, you must set your inventory to be viewed by everyone in your privacy setting.
